## **Exploratory Data Analysis in Python- Stanford Open Policing Project**

* This is a dataset on Traffic and Pedestrian Stops by Police in Rhode Island from [The Stanford Open Policing Project ](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

* This project is made for practicing exploratory data analysis by using pandas in Python

* In this project, I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. Do men or women speed more often? 
2. Does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding?
3. Does gender affect whose vehicle is searched?
4. Does gender affect who is frisked during a search?
5. Does time of day affect arrest rate?
6. Are drug-related stops on the rise?
7. What violations are caught in each race?
8. How long might you be stopped for a violation?
9. Which year had the least number of stops?

* Most of the analysis is based on the Course- [Analyzing Police Activity with pandas](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-police-activity-with-pandas/preparing-the-data-for-analysis?ex=1)
