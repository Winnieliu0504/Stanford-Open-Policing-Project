Do men or women speed more often? \n2. Does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding?\n3. Does gender affect whose vehicle is searched?\n4. Does gender affect who is frisked during a search?\n5. Does time of day affect arrest rate?\n6. Are drug-related stops on the rise?\n7. What violations are caught in each race?\n8. How long might you be stopped for a violation?\n9. Which year had the least number of stops?\n\n* Most of the analysis is based on the Course- [Analyzing Police Activity with pandas](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-police-activity-with-pandas/preparing-the-data-for-analysis?ex=1)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas_profiling import ProfileReport\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \npd.set_option(\"display.precision\", 3)\npd.set_option(\"display.expand_frame_repr\", False)\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 30)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.386901Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.38733Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.402177Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.387284Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.400783Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Input = '/kaggle/input/stanford-open-policing-project/police_project.csv'\ndata= pd.read_csv(Input)\ndata.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.404033Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.404492Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.72305Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.404455Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.721776Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.isnull().sum())\nprint(data.shape)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.725642Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.726109Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.820524Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.726058Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.819228Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The data contains 91741 rows and 15 columns, which is showed by the shape of the data above.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.columns)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.822728Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.823268Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.831448Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.823195Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.829925Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"profile = ProfileReport(data, \n                        title=\"Policing Profiling Report\",\n                       interactions=None,\n                       duplicates=None)\nprofile","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.833333Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.833687Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-15T13:49:41.1169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-15T13:49:13.833655Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-15T13:49:41.115318Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Preparing the Data(ETL)**  ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before beginning your analysis, it is critical that you first examine and clean the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.
